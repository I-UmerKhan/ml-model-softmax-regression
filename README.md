# ml-model-softmax-regression
I learned about softmax regression, which is used in scenarios where there are multiple output classes or categories, such as "yes," "no," and "maybe." It extends logistic regression to handle multinomial classification tasks by predicting the probabilities of each class and ensuring they sum up to one.
